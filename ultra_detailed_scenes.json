      "scene_prompt": "COASTAL BEACH - BRIGHT MIDDAY (Sailboat Wreck Scene)\n\nEXT. SANDY BEACH - The camera is positioned at a low angle, child-height perspective looking straight on at the subject. A small figure stands in the foreground wearing a crisp white captain's hat with gold naval insignia and bright coral-colored life vest. Behind them, a dramatic scene unfolds with a large white sailboat capsized at a 45-degree angle, its masts creating stark diagonal lines against the vivid blue sky scattered with puffy clouds.\n\nThe lighting is naturally bright and coastal, with strong highlights on the white boat hull and soft shadows cast by the rigging. The color palette contrasts warm sandy tones against cool maritime blues. The background shows gentle hills and calm waters, creating a serene backdrop to the dramatic wreck.\n\nIn the mid-ground, the beached sailboat's details are clearly visible - navigation equipment, deck hardware, and tangled rigging creating visual texture. The boat's position suggests it was driven ashore, perhaps during a storm, now settled into the sand at an awkward angle.\n\nThe composition follows the rule of thirds, with the small figure positioned left of center and the dramatic boat angles leading the eye through the frame. Natural lens compression keeps both subject and boat in sharp focus while slightly blurring the distant shoreline.",
      "cinematic_notes": "Shot on wide angle lens (24-35mm equivalent) to capture both the intimate foreground subject and the scale of the boat wreck. Camera positioned slightly below eye level to emphasize the child-sized perspective while still showing the full boat. Natural lighting with slight polarization to control glare and enhance sky/water separation. Color grade emphasizes the contrast between warm skin tones/life vest and cool maritime colors. Static shot allows the dramatic composition to do the heavy lifting.",

      "description": "A humorous financial scene set in a nursery, where a toddler in a high chair appears to be mimicking an investment guru or financial advisor, positioned next to an exaggerated stack of prop money bundles.

      "scene_prompt": "NURSERY - DAY (WSJ Live watermark visible)[Beginning] In a softly-lit modern nursery, gentle natural light filters through off-screen windows, creating a warm domestic atmosphere. A wooden crib stands in the background near white dresser drawers. In the foreground, a toddler wearing a crisp white t-shirt sits in a wooden high chair, positioned behind a computer keyboard. To their right, an impressive stack of prop money bundles rises dramatically in frame. The lighting is clean and even, with soft shadows suggesting mid-morning illumination.The camera holds steady at a direct front-on medium shot as the toddler gazes slightly upward with an innocent, attentive expression. The money stack remains perfectly still, each bundle visible with red paper bands clearly defined.[Middle] As the dialogue 'We're just gonna eat right and save it' begins in a playful adult voice-over, subtle energy builds in the toddler's posture. The camera maintains its steady position while capturing the growing anticipation in the scene.[End] The sequence culminates as the toddler suddenly lurches forward with enthusiastic determination, small hands reaching toward the mountain of cash bundles just as the emphatic 'Boom!' punctuates the audio. The movement is quick but controlled, with the high chair and money stack maintaining their established positions while only the toddler creates dynamic motion.Throughout the scene, the nursery setting maintains consistent soft, natural illumination. The white furniture and walls create a clean, contemporary backdrop that allows the green of the money stack and the toddler's animated performance to command focus.",

      "cinematic_notes": "Camera maintains a static, front-facing position throughout the sequence. Lighting focuses on creating depth through subtle purple gradients, darkening at the edges to create a vignette effect. Typography animations should be crisp and precise, with careful attention to kerning and spacing. The green asterisk provides the only color accent, making it a focal point. Sound design should be minimal and corporate, matching the sophisticated visual aesthetic.",
