      "scene_prompt": "LUXURY YACHT - BRIGHT MIDDAY (Split Screen Effect)[Beginning] The scene opens with a dynamic split-screen composition. On the left, in bright natural lighting, we see an extreme close-up of pure childlike joy - a toddler in a pristine white naval captain's hat with gold braiding and anchor insignia, their face beaming with unbridled enthusiasm against a soft-focus background. The right side of the frame reveals a wide shot of a luxury yacht's polished teak deck where several figures lounge in swimwear, their poses casual and relaxed as the vessel cuts through crystal blue waters against a backdrop of dramatic coastal cliffs.[Middle] The yacht's occupants shift positions slightly on the sun-drenched deck, their movements suggesting the gentle roll of ocean waves. The wooden deck gleams with a honey-gold patina, while the white fiberglass hull creates striking geometric lines in the composition. The azure sky and turquoise water provide a perfect color harmony with the vessel's nautical whites and woods.[End] The sequence maintains its split-screen duality throughout, creating a charming contrast between maritime authority and maritime leisure. The bright, direct sunlight creates crisp shadows and highlights across both frames, while the yacht's angle relative to the sun casts interesting diagonal patterns across its deck.Throughout the scene, natural maritime lighting bathes everything in bright, clean illumination. The color palette stays consistently nautical with whites, blues, and warm wood tones dominating. The mood is one of pure joy and carefree summer leisure.",

The background reveals a stark white sailboat laying on its side, masts angled dramatically against a crystal blue sky dotted with wispy clouds.\n\nThe camera holds steady at child-height eye level, capturing the solemn gravity of the scene. The lighting is bright and natural, with soft shadows cast by the late morning sun creating depth across the beach sand. Behind our subject, the capsized vessel's white hull gleams brilliantly against the turquoise waters and sandy shore.\n\n[Middle] The composition maintains perfect balance between the figure in the foreground and the fallen boat behind, creating visual tension through their size disparity. The masts of the sailboat slice diagonally through the frame, leading the eye from the figure up toward the clouded sky.\n\n[End] The scene holds its dramatic framing as the boat remains beached on its side, rigging and lines hanging limply. The pristine captain's hat and life vest stand in sharp relief against the nautical disaster scene playing out in the background.\n\nThroughout the sequence, natural seaside lighting bathes everything in bright, slightly warm tones.

To their right, an impressive stack of prop money bundles rises dramatically in frame. The nursery setting features a white dresser and wooden crib in the background, creating a striking contrast between the innocent baby environment and mock financial setup.As the unseen narrator begins 'We're just gonna eat right and save it...', the camera holds steady at a straight-on medium shot, capturing the toddler's attentive expression and the full scale of the money pile.[Middle] The toddler's posture and energy shifts forward with building anticipation, their body language becoming more animated. The lighting remains consistent and warm, highlighting the natural wood tones of the furniture against the neutral walls.[End] Right as the narrator punctuates with an enthusiastic 'Boom!', the toddler lunges forward in the high chair, reaching excitedly toward the stack of money bundles. The camera maintains its fixed position, allowing the natural comedy of the movement to play out in frame. The nursery backdrop remains steady, grounding the whimsical financial theme in a child's everyday environment.Throughout the scene, soft natural lighting from unseen windows creates gentle shadows and highlights the textures of the wooden furniture, while keeping the money props and toddler's expressions clearly visible.

Two pristine white letters - 'E' and 'T' - hover at opposite ends of the frame, connected by a thin white line that stretches between them. The lighting is soft yet dramatic, with subtle volumetric effects giving depth to the purple environment.\n\nAs the sequence begins, the letters gracefully glide toward each other along the connecting line. The camera slowly pushes in, maintaining perfect composition as the typography animates. The background purple gradients subtly shift and pulse, creating a sense of depth and dimension.\n\nThe letters converge at center frame as additional typography fades in to complete the E*TRADE logo, including their distinctive green asterisk emblem. The tagline 'LESS FOR US | MORE FOR YOU' materializes beneath in clean white text, perfectly centered. The entire composition breathes with subtle motion, never fully static.\n\nThe camera continues its gentle push as legal text smoothly fades up at the bottom of frame. The WSJ Live logo maintains its position in the lower right corner throughout. All elements are precisely balanced within the 16:9 frame, with the purple environment providing rich contrast for the white text elements.\n\nThe sequence concludes with all elements locked in their final positions - the complete E*TRADE brand identity floating in the purple void, commanding attention while maintaining corporate elegance.",
